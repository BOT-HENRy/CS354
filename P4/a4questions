For ALL cache simulations, use a capacity of 16384 bytes for both 
the I-cache and the D-cache.

cache1D
-------

Describe how you tested your code to verify that it works.
	Add a line that can print out the elements in the array and its index.

What do you get from running pin with a block size of 4 bytes?
	Instruction cache misses:	5931
	Instruction cache references:	695778
	Data cache misses:		107640
	Data cache references:		646567


What is the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 4 bytes?
	99.15%
What is the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 4 bytes?
	83.35%
What do you get from running pin with a block size of 32 bytes?
	Instruction cache misses:	1177
	Instruction cache references:	695778
	Data cache misses:		15052
	Data cache references:		646567

What is the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 32 bytes?
	99.83%
What is the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 32 bytes?
	97.67%
What do you get from running pin with a block size of 64 bytes?
	Instruction cache misses:	707
	Instruction cache references:	695778
	Data cache misses:		8509
	Data cache references:		646567

What is the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?
	99.90%
What is the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?
	98.68%
Which block size is best for the I-cache?  Why?
	The 64 bytes block size is the best for I-cache. Because using 64 bytes allows more bytes to go through the block so the cache misses is fewer.
Which block size is best for the D-cache?  Why? In what way does the block size affect the hit ratio for this program?
	The 64 bytes size is the best for D-cache. Because the 64 bytes block size allows larger amount of data to transfer. Bigger size tend to has higher ratio in this program.

What do you get from running pin with a block size of 64 bytes?
	Instruction cache misses:	707
	Instruction cache references:	16599298
	Data cache misses:		1507402
	Data cache references:		12049070

What is the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?
	99.99%
What is the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?
	87.49%

Comparison of cache2Drows and cache2Dcols
-----------------------------------------

Compare the performance (hit ratios) of the I-cache for these 2 programs.
Justify your statistics.
	The hit ratios of the I-cache for these 2 programs are almost the same. So they have very similar performance.

Compare the performance (hit ratios) of the D-cache for these 2 programs.
Explain any differences.
	The hit ratios of the D-cache is higher in the "cache2Drows", so it is more efficient to let the inner loop work its way through a single row of the array, and the outer loop iterates through the rows. The cache miss is lower per unit block.
